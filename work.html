    <h4 id = "turtlebot">Turtlebot Autonomous Food Pickup/Delivery
</h4>
    <p>This project was to develop a ROS package for a Turtlebot to pick up and deliver requested food.
The robot explores an unknown world using Lidar and SLAM node gmapping for robot pose and occupancy grid.
It explores and maps the  environment by following given rviz waypoints and calculating shortest path solution from either A* or bidirectional rrt. While exploring, the robot uses a pre-trained CNN detector to recognize different food vendors and keeps track of their positions to revisit later.</p>

</h4>
    <p>This mechatronics project was to build an arcade game that interacts with players by analog sensing and non-contact sensing and return feedback with audio and motion. Everything was coded in C, and I worked mainly on the circuits and coding portion of the project.
The game was designed to simulate cooking a potato while completing tasks to keep the “fire” going. </p>

    <p>This project was to develop controllers for a Volkswagen Golf GTI to autonomously drive an oval path.
    I worked to develop a longitudinal lookahead controller and a PID controller that were able to drive an unmanned car with stable system.</p>

    <p>This project was to design and manufacture a water pump driven by wind turbine. The requirement was to pump water from an input reservoir with water level at the drive shift to an elevation of at least 1.5 m at a rate of 1 L/min. I worked on mechanical analysis of the design, prototyping, machining parts, and assembling the pump.  <p>

    <p>This was a project done in a Stanford PRL course. I designed a stackable glasses holder to hold multiple glasses taking minimal space. The glasses holder was then redesigned to be mass produced via injection molding and sand casting. The following document outlines the design and machining sequence for the glasses holder.</p>

  <h4>Tesla Motors Intern Mechanical Design Engineer
</h4>
<h5>Jun 2020 – Sep 2020
</h5>
  <p>The project I took on at Tesla was to design and prototype a new battery runaway flame mitigation mechanism of Powerwall. While details of the design cannot be discussed, I honed skills in DFM and GD&T by designing, quoting, and delivering manufacturing drawings and assembly instructions of the design to international suppliers and in-house shops for on-time delivery.
</p>
<p>
After the machined parts were delivered and assembled, I worked on the lab setup with LabView, temperature, pressure sensors, and FTIR gas analyzer to collect critical datapoint for thermal and pressure modeling. I executed the DOE to validate the design and certify for a UL requirement. The results from the DOE proved valuable for structural failure analysis and future product design.  <p>
  <h4>Samsung Electronics Associate Product Manager
  </h4>
  <h5>Jan 2018 – May 2019
  </h5>
  <p>Before joining graduate school at Stanford, I worked full-time at Samsung Electronics for about a year and 4 months as an associate product manager. Coming from a mechanical engineering background was of great value when analyzing manufacturing difficulties and revising solution that can be communicated with international suppliers. I worked to launch smart home products and successfully drove overall product development schedule to pass different reliability tests and UL qualifications. I strived to identify product positioning strategy in smart home market and mid- to long-term roadmap through analysis of customer data and user studies. Working as a product manager allowed to gain expertise in communicating across teams and carrying out effective product launch cycle.  </p>

  <h4>ASML Intern Mechanical Design Engineer
  </h4>
  <h5>Aug 2016 – Dec 2016, May 2017 – Aug 2017
  </h5>
  <p>My project at ASML was centered around optimizing the geometry and positioning of the glass optics in EUV systems. I was able to design a new candidate fixture that utilizes vacuum volume to prevent over-constraints when holding down the optics. I developed and executed test DOEs in the clean room to analyze source of optics drift due to humidity and temperature. I also worked to develop a Matlab GUI that process high volume of client’s optics drift failure data for failure analysis and visualization. At ASML, I was able to hone my skills in DFM, FEA analysis, and data analysis for failure.</p>
